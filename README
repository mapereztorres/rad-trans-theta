RadTransTheta.py  - @ by  Iván Martí-Vidal and Miguel Pérez-Torres
  Output: Rff_2D.dat  

  Script to compute the 2D radiative transfer of synchrotron radiation 
  observed from a counterjet of 1 unit of intrinsic emission 
  (in normalized units), taking into account free-free absorption from 
  a torus and an external medium as described in Mattila, Perez-Torres et 
  al. It also takes into account Doppler boosting/de-boosting of the counterjet, 
  as well as light-travel time effects.


betaThetaPlot-2D.py - @ by  Iván Martí-Vidal and Miguel Pérez-Torres
  Input: Rff_2D.dat  (the output from RadTransTheta.py)
  Output: BetaTheta_2D.png, .pdf

  Script to generate the Theta-beta parameter space plot, which constrains the
  allowed values of beta and theta for an expanding jet. 
  It uses constraints from radio interferometric observations. Namely the 
  apparent speed of the jet, as well as the jet-to-counterjet radio, R. 
  The values in the code apply to the TDE Arp299B-AT1, and follows the
  observations reported in Mattila, Pérez-Torres et al., but the code is of
  general use and can thus be used for any other jet.   

  If you use any of those scripts, or a modification of any of them, we'd
  appreciate if you gave due credit by citing this work.
